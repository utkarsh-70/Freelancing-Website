<h3>Most Important Terms & Conditions for customers</h3>
<p>
These Terms & Conditions, specifically for customers, are in addition to the other generic Terms & Conditions listed on the page which are common to all the users of the site. Any violation of these T&Cs may result in an customer’s issue being declined for publication on IRS or his/her account being permanently blocked.
</p>

<h3>issue Posting T&Cs:</h3>
<p>
It is your responsibility to ensure that you are authorized to post issues. Any dispute or legal claim arising out of unauthorized posting would be solely your liability and you indemnify IRS of any and all possible consequences of such actions.
You must provide accurate and complete details about the organization and the issue – too brief or too vague a description of the organization, or issue profile results in poor quality issue post and hence may get declined. Any act of misinformation or hiding material information would result in your account being permanently blocked.
You may be asked for documents in the name of your company for our first-time user authentication process. This information will only be used for authentication purposes and will not be used anywhere else in any form.
</p>

<h3>IRS does not allow:</h3>
<p>
Unpaid issues, except for NGOs/NPOs & some niche profiles (Law, Experimental Physics, Library Science, and the likes).
Training program and any such program where service providers are expected to pay a security deposit or an admission fee.
Modelling issues from unknown or lesser known companies.
Network Level Marketing (NLM) issues.
Any issue where there is a possibility for an intern of consuming alcohol or smoking or inducing others to do so, as the majority of our users are underage.
Businesses promoting explicit religious content, a particular religious personality or a sect etc. are not allowed to post issues on IRS.
Businesses promoting or dealing in gambling and related games.
Third party issue posting. You can post issues only for the organization that you directly work for. Recruiting agencies or any third party agencies are not authorized to post issues on their clients’ behalf. Any such issues will be declined and the account may be permanently blocked on IRS.
</p>

<h3>Hiring T&Cs:</h3>
<p>
It is your responsibility to ensure that there is no material difference between the issue details that are advertised on IRS and the details that are communicated to service providers later in the selection process (pre-interview, in offer letter etc.). Any ‘negative’ material difference (such as offered stipend being lower than what was advertised) may result in your account being permanently blocked on IRS.
You must respond to any service provider complaints regarding your issue post that we may bring to your notice within 72 working hours. Failure do so may result in temporary suspension of your issue post till we receive a response from you.
If you come across any suspicious activity, content or behaviour on IRS by a service provider or another user, you must report it to IRS immediately so that necessary actions can be taken.
While we put our best efforts to reach out to the best intern talent available in the country, posting your issue on IRS does not guarantee hiring of an intern.
</p>

<h3>General T&Cs:</h3>
<p>
You can use the applicants’ data that you receive for your issue solely for the purpose of intern hiring. Any attempt to send any other communication (promotional content for example) to the applicants or any other usage of the data is strictly prohibited.
You are strictly prohibited from transferring/selling/sharing applicants’ data, for free or for a fee, to any other entity. Any such attempt would result in your account on IRS being permanently blocked and would be liable for legal action against you and your organization. We take our users’ data privacy and protection very seriously and have zero tolerance policy towards it.
IRS reserves the right to publish the issue post of companies on social media platforms and websites like LinkedIn, Indeed, Sheroes, Qween, etc., along with newspapers and magazines in order to increase the visibility of the issue post.
Most Important Terms & Conditions for service provider Users
<br />
If you have applied for an issue on IRS and receive a communication from IRS or hiring organization regarding your application, you must respond to it with-in 72 hours.
Once you accept an issue offer, you must make every possible effort to join and start the issue on time. To not show up or to decline an earlier accepted issue offer at the last moment, or to go incommunicado creates a very poor impression of you in front of the customer and reduces the credibility of the service provider community at large. Any such behaviour will not only result in your account being blocked on IRS but we will also report it to your college administration.
You must provide with accurate and complete information at the time of issue application or creating an account on IRS – any misrepresentation of information, or hiding of material information, or impersonation would result in your account being blocked on the site and you being reported to your college administration.
You must pay attention to an issue’s complete details (profile, start date, location, duration, whether paid or unpaid, skills required etc.) before applying for it. Irrelevant applications will result in your account being penalized (we may stop you from applying to future issues or block you account all together)
You are strictly prohibited from transferring/selling/sharing customer’ data (contact details etc.), for free or for a fee, with any other entity. Any such attempt would result in your account on IRS being permanently blocked and would be liable for legal action against you. We take our users’ data privacy and protection very seriously and have zero tolerance policy towards it.
If you come across any suspicious activity, content or behaviour on IRS by an customer or another user, you must report it to IRS immediately so that necessary actions can be taken – this is both your duty and obligation.
While we make our best efforts to bring you the best issue opportunities possible, IRS does not guarantee an issue to a service provider.
